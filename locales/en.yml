          Must specify IP used to contact VM from host
          
          When vagrant does not know the IP of the VM, you must specify it
          in chef_ip key of the HatchProvisioner configuration.
          It is used by knife to upload the cookbooks etc to the VM's chef
          solo during bootstrapping.
